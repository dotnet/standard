There is also a GitHub team **@nsboard** you can use for tagging when you want
the board to take a look at a particular issue or pull requests.

## Member Criteria

The purpose of the .NET Standard review board is to sign-off on API additions to
the .NET Standard.

The board comprises representatives from two general areas:

* **Providers of .NET implementations**. These are parties that have their own
  implementation of .NET and would like to provide input into which concepts can
  be implemented

* **.NET Foundation**. This is a list of people selected by the .NET Foundation
  who represent the interest of the .NET community.

The .NET Standard review board will also have a chair. For the most part, we
strive to make decisions based on consensus, but as it is with every group of
engineers, consensus can be impossible to achieve at times so we need to have an
ultimate tie breaker.

Please note that the member list isn't meant to be closed: as more platform
vendors and API drivers appear, the review board will expand accordingly.
